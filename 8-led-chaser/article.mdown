## Pattern based 8 LED Chaser

Last night I completed a simple 8 LED Chaser.
The hardware is identical to the Arduino Examples using the [74HC595 Shift Register](http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/74HC_HCT595.pdf).

Although you can find a very detailed tutorial of the hardware on this [Arduino page](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ShiftOut), I'll go over the basics here.

## What you'll need

* Arduino Uno
* Breadboard (a large one, or perhaps two smaller ones)
* Quite a few Jumper Wires
* 1x 74HC595 Shift Register
* 8x Single Colour LEDs
* 8x 330&#8486; resistors

Note: almost all the projects I put together use the [SparkFun Arduino UNO Inventors Kit](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10173) and [SparkFun Beginner Parts Kit](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10003) which you can buy at [ToysDownUnder.com](http://toysdownunder.com/arduino).
