## RaspberryPi Bootstrap

I've been working on a bootstrap script for RaspberryPi that:
- Updates the RaspberryPi OS and Firmware
- Python, Ruby and all the hacking Essentials setup
- Gets x11vnc running on boot (so you can VNC into the actual display)
- Makes the Pi work with Apple's Screen and File Sharing 

Getting x11vnc setup and running on boot took forever to workout, so enjoy the end result :P
